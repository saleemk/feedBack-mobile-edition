"""feedpak spec-conformance gate.

feedpak is an open, versioned format with its own normative spec, JSON Schemas,
and reference validator (https://github.com/got-feedback/feedpak-spec). That
makes the spec a contract with everyone outside this repo: third-party packers,
converters, and players build against it. When core reads a manifest key the
spec never defined, the contract quietly breaks — a spec-compliant pack stops
being a fully-working pack, and the format's real definition migrates into our
source tree. See #933 for the instance that motivated this gate.

We cannot mechanically prove core *interprets* a key the way the spec means. We
can prove four surface properties, and those cover the drift that actually
happens:

  1. key-coverage    — every manifest key core reads OR WRITES is declared by the
                       spec. (Guarded by check_readers_complete(), so the list of
                       scanned modules cannot quietly fall behind the codebase.)
  2. allowlist-closed— feedpak-spec-exceptions.yml never grows. It grandfathers
                       keys that predate this gate; it is not a way to merge a
                       new one. The only route for a new key is the FEP process.
  3. forward         — core ingests the spec's own example packs.
  4. reverse         — packs committed here satisfy the spec's reference validator.

Dev/CI tooling only: never imported on the serve or Docker path (constitution
Principle I — same category as scripts/build-tailwind.sh). `jsonschema` is
therefore a CI-only dependency, not a runtime requirement.

Usage:
    python tools/check_spec_conformance.py --spec <path-to-feedpak-spec-checkout>

Exit status is 0 only when every layer passes.
